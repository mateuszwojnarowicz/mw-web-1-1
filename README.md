This is a beginner web development website project which I learned in this course: [A link to a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
Througout the project I use, and demonstrate knowledge, of these technologies:

 - HTMML5
 - CSS3
 - jQuery
 
 And also knowledge of Web Design.
